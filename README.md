## Description

This Java project uses ACM libraries to draw an approximation of Srinivasa Ramanujan's portrait and Dragon using epicycles based on the complex Fourier series. The program generates mesmerizing visualizations by combining mathematical concepts with artistic representation.

## Features

- Utilizes ACM libraries for graphics.
- Approximates the drawing using complex Fourier series and epicycles.
- User interface for real-time changes.
